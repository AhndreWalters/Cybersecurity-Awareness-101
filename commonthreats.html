            <h1>Common Cybersecurity Threats</h1>
            <p>Cyber threats come in many forms. Understanding how they work is the first step in protecting yourself online. Below are some of the most common types.</p>

            <h2>Malware</h2>
            <p>Malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to systems.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Viruses - programs that attach to files and spread when shared.</li>
                <li>Worms - self-replicating programs that spread through networks.</li>
                <li>Ransomware - locks your files and demands payment for access.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Phishing</h2>
            <p>Attempts to trick users into giving up personal information, often through fake emails, websites, or messages.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Email scams - appear to come from trusted sources.</li>
                <li>Fake websites - mimic real sites to steal logins or payment info.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Social Engineering</h2>
            <p>Exploiting human behavior to gain information rather than hacking technology.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pretexting - creating a fake scenario to trick you into giving details.</li>
                <li>Baiting - offering something tempting (like free downloads) that contains malware.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Password Attacks</h2>
            <p>Methods to crack or steal weak, reused, or stolen passwords.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Brute force - guessing combinations until the correct one is found.</li>
                <li>Credential stuffing - using leaked passwords from other sites.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Public Wi-Fi Risks</h2>
            <p>Unsecured Wi-Fi networks allow attackers to intercept data.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Man-in-the-middle attacks - intercepting communication between you and a site.</li>
                <li>Data theft - capturing passwords, emails, or financial info.</li>
            </ol><br>
